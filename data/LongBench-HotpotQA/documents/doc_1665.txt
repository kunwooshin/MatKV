Reginald Crawford (died 1307)
Sir Reginald Crawford (died 17 February 1307) was a Scottish knight who took part in the Wars of Scottish Independence.
In 1296 he was appointed as Sheriff of Ayr by the English administration.  In June 1297 he was one of several Scots nobles who did a deal where they were released by the English to fight against Andrew Moray.  This suggests that he may have taken  part in the revolt in early 1297 which ended in the capitulation at Irvine. 
He became a supporter of Robert the Bruce and was captured during the Battle of Loch Ryan in February 1307. He was executed by hanging in Carlisle, England.He may have been related to the Ronald Crawford who was hanged at the Barns of Ayr, but this issue is surrounded by uncertainty and later legend.
