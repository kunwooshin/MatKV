Rabi cycle
In physics, the Rabi cycle (or Rabi flop) is the cyclic behaviour of a two-level quantum system in the presence of an oscillatory driving field. A great variety of physical processes belonging to the areas of quantum computing, condensed matter, atomic and molecular physics, and nuclear and particle physics can be conveniently studied in terms of two-level quantum mechanical systems, and exhibit Rabi flopping when coupled to an optical driving field. The effect is important in quantum optics, magnetic resonance and quantum computing, and is named after Isidor Isaac Rabi.
A two-level system is one that has two possible energy levels. These two levels are a ground state with lower energy and an excited state with higher energy. If the energy levels are not degenerate (i.e. not having equal energies), the system can absorb a quantum of energy and transition from the ground state to the "excited" state. When an atom (or some other two-level system) is illuminated by a coherent beam of photons, it will cyclically absorb photons and re-emit them by stimulated emission. One such cycle is called a Rabi cycle, and the inverse of its duration is the Rabi frequency of the photon beam. The effect can be modeled using the Jaynes–Cummings model and the Bloch vector formalism.

Mathematical description
A detailed mathematical description of the effect can be found on the page for the Rabi problem. For example, for a two-state atom (an atom in which an electron can either be in the excited or ground state) in an electromagnetic field with frequency tuned to the excitation energy, the probability of finding the atom in the excited state is found from the Bloch equations to be

More generally, one can consider a system where the two levels under consideration are not energy eigenstates. Therefore, if the system is initialized in one of these levels, time evolution will make the population of each of the levels oscillate with some characteristic frequency, whose angular frequency is also known as the Rabi frequency. The state of a two-state quantum system can be represented as vectors of a two-dimensional complex Hilbert space, which means that every state vector

All observable physical quantities associated with this systems are 2 × 2 Hermitian matrices, which means that the Hamiltonian of the system is also a similar matrix.

Procedure
One can construct an oscillation experiment through the following steps:
Prepare the system in a fixed state; for example, 
  
    
      
        
          |
        
        1
        ⟩
      
    
    {\displaystyle |1\rangle }
  
Let the state evolve freely, under a Hamiltonian H for time t
Find the probability 
  
    
      
        P
        (
        t
        )
      
    
    {\displaystyle P(t)}
  , that the state is in 
  
    
      
        
          |
        
        1
        ⟩
      
    
    {\displaystyle |1\rangle }
  If 
  
    
      
        
          |
        
        1
        ⟩
      
    
    {\displaystyle |1\rangle }
   is an eigenstate of H, 
  
    
      
        P
        (
        t
        )
        =
        1
      
    
    {\displaystyle P(t)=1}
   and there will be no oscillations. Also if the two states 
  
    
      
        
          |
        
        0
        ⟩
      
    
    {\displaystyle |0\rangle }
   and 
  
    
      
        
          |
        
        1
        ⟩
      
    
    {\displaystyle |1\rangle }
   are degenerate, every state including 
  
    
      
        
          |
        
        1
        ⟩
      
    
    {\displaystyle |1\rangle }
   is an eigenstate of H. As a result, there will be no oscillations.
On the other hand, if H has no degenerate eigenstates, and the initial state is not an eigenstate, then there will be oscillations. The most general form of the Hamiltonian of a two-state system is given

    {\displaystyle E_{-}\leq E_{+}}
  . So in this case the probability of finding spin-up in x-direction is oscillatory in time

    {\displaystyle {\tfrac {1}{2}}}
  . In the degenerate case where

  , the characteristic frequency is 0 and there is no oscillation.
Notice that if a system is in an eigenstate of a given Hamiltonian, the system remains in that state.
This is true even for time dependent Hamiltonians. Taking for example

    {\displaystyle \Omega ={\sqrt {(\omega -\omega _{0})^{2}+\omega _{1}^{2}}}}
  .  This phenomenon is called Rabi oscillation.  Thus, the qubit oscillates between the 
  
    
      
        
          |
        
        0

        1
        ⟩
      
    
    {\displaystyle |1\rangle }
   states. The maximum amplitude for oscillation is achieved at 
  
    
      
        ω
        =

  . This operation has crucial importance in quantum computing. The equations are essentially identical in the case of a two level atom in the field of a laser when the generally well satisfied rotating wave approximation is made. Then

    {\displaystyle \omega _{1}\propto \hbar \ {\vec {d}}\cdot {\vec {E}}}
  . In summary, Rabi oscillations are the basic process used to manipulate qubits. These oscillations are obtained by exposing qubits to periodic electric or magnetic fields during suitably adjusted time intervals.
