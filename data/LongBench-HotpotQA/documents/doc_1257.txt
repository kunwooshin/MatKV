BBC Films
BBC Film (formerly BBC Films) is the feature film-making arm of the BBC. It was founded on 18 June 1990, and has produced or co-produced some of the most successful British films of recent years, including Truly, Madly, Deeply, Alan Partridge: Alpha Papa, Quartet, Salmon Fishing in the Yemen, Saving Mr. Banks, My Week with Marilyn, Eastern Promises, Match Point, Jane Eyre, In the Loop, An Education, StreetDance 3D, Fish Tank, The History Boys, Nativity!, Iris, Notes on a Scandal,  Philomena, Stan & Ollie, Man Up, Billy Elliot and Brooklyn.
BBC Film co-produces around eight films a year, working in partnership with major international and UK distributors. Rose Garnett is Head of BBC Film, responsible for the development and production slate, strategy and business operations.The company was founded in 1990 by David M. Thompson as a wholly owned but independent film-making company, based in offices in Mortimer Street, London. A restructuring in 2007 integrated it into the main BBC Fiction department of BBC Vision. As a result, it moved out of its independent offices into BBC Television Centre, and Thompson left to start his own film production company. BBC Film has been based at Broadcasting House in London since 2013. The company changed its name to BBC Film in 2020, and it has been announced that the Storyville documentary strand has come under its remit.
