Worker
The major economic activity of the village is agriculture, mainly subsistence based, and carpet weaving. The landless people weave the famous bhadohi woolen carpets but not the people from higher caste of Brahmins. Many people have migrated to Kolkata and Mumbai and post order money is a very prominent source of income. There is one rabi crop of wheat and another kharif crop of rice mainly with help of irrigation by ground water pumped through a government-installed bore well and a couple of private ones. There is hardly any commercial cropping. Much of land is alkaline, posing a great difficulty to agricultural activity.
