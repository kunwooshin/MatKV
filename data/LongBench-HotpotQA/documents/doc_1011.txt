APA Psychotherapy Caucus
Plakun led the effort that culminated in the founding of the American Psychiatric Association Psychotherapy Caucus, established in 2014. The purpose of the caucus is to connect APA members who share an interest in psychotherapy and psychosocial treatments as well as to "raise the profile of psychotherapy and psychosocial treatment in psychiatry, and to secure skills in these areas as part of the training and identity of future psychiatrists so the field and its practitioners are practicing within a genuinely biopsychosocial model." The caucus is engaged in a number of advocacy and educational activities and currently has close to 300 members.

Research and writing
Plakun is the editor of New Perspectives on Narcissism (American Psychiatric Press, 1990) and Treatment Resistance and Patient Authority: The Austen Riggs Reader (W.W. Norton & Company, 2011) and author of nearly 100 articles and book chapters on the diagnosis, treatment, longitudinal course and outcome of patients with borderline personality disorder, treatment resistant disorders, and on shared elements of various schools of psychotherapy. An advocate for the value of psychotherapy and psychosocial treatment, Plakun has argued for the full implementation of the Mental Health Parity and Addictions Equity Act, served as Plaintiffs’ expert on adult mental disorders in Wit v. United Behavioral Health federal class-action, and has presented and written about the case. He has also researched and written on what he calls "Psychiatry’s False Assumptions":  [1] genes = disease; [2] patients present with single disorders that respond to specific evidence-based treatments; and [3] the best treatments are pills. Separately, he has written about psychodynamic residential treatment for patients who have encountered an impasse in their treatment and has called for an evidence-based, inclusive reconceptualization of how psychotherapy competencies are presented and taught to residents.
