Background
After announcing the Wonder Girls as spokesmodels for the brand "Marshpuff" in Japan, JYPE requested that their Japanese record label, DefStar Records, listen to the Wonder Girls' released albums and singles before deciding on what song would be their debut in the country. The label had strong mutual interest in "Nobody", so it was chosen as the title song for their first Japanese album.In May 2012, the Wonder Girls officially announced their debut into the Japanese market with a Japanese version of "Nobody", "Nobody ～あなたしか見えない～". JYP JYPE stated: "Wonder Girls have received numerous inquiries from Japan and [are] observing their advertisement and music business flourishing even without their official introduction."
The EP was released on July 25, 2012 in three different physical variants.
