History
Development
The mall, the first SM Supermall outside of Metro Manila, opened on November 27, 1993, with a gross floor area of 161,562 square metres (1,739,040 sq ft). It was seen as catering to the broad low- and middle-class shoppers, in contrast to its upscale competitor, the Ayala Corporation-owned Ayala Center Cebu which opened a few months later.
Located in Cebu City's North Reclamation Area, then a quiet and relatively remote part of the city, the mall had Manila-based movie and television stars and entertainers perform free concerts at the mall to attract shoppers. Free jeepney rides to the mall were also offered to fulfill the lack of available public transportation within the area.

Northwing
Construction on SM City Cebu's expansion building, dubbed the Northwing, began in March 2006. The expansion, which was developed at a cost of â‚±1.3 billion (US$30.5 million), was built on the parking lot to the north of the existing building, temporarily decreasing the number of parking spaces by more than 30%.  Construction of the Northwing started in April 2006, and opened on November 30, 2007. It increased the total gross floor area of SM City Cebu by 107,049 m2 (1,152,270 sq ft), for a total of 268,611 m2 (2,891,300 sq ft). The first 2 floors are for the mall's expansion, while the 3rd, 4th and 5th floors are for the indoor carpark including the roof deck.

Northwing Expansion
An expansion is planned for the Northwing, which will also include two 20-storey office buildings intended to cater to business process outsourcing companies, as well as a 9-storey building which will house a campus of National University. It is set to be completed by 2025. At the same time, a major renovation of its interior is ongoing, starting with the area near Ace Hardware and SM Appliance Center.

Design
SM City Cebu is a seven-level complex namely lower ground floor, upper ground floor, second floor, third floor, fourth floor, fifth floor, and roof deck featuring a total of eight cinemas with seven regular cinemas and one IMAX theater with a total seating capacity of 5,812, a food court, a fully computerized bowling center, 8,000-square meter amusement center, and a 2,000-square meter trade hall. Prior to the addition of the Northwing, it had a car park capacity of 1,629.The Northwing expansion, opened in 2007, features two floors of retail stores, restaurants, and cafes. It houses more than 200 tenants and caters to a more upscale clientele. The expansion also added three levels of covered parking, and a one level of roof deck parking.

Transport
The Cebu North Bus Terminal is situated inside the mall compound opposite the mall's parking area with the lot granted by SM Prime for free for a period of two years, after its lease in its former location in Subangdaku, Mandaue expired in early 2020. It was officially opened on October 12, 2020, with full operations starting on October 15, 2020.
