Burlingame Daily News
The Burlingame Daily News was a free daily newspaper in Burlingame, California published six days a week with an average daily circulation of 7,000. The newspaper was founded August 9, 2000 by Dave Price (journalist) and Jim Pavelich, who also published the Palo Alto Daily News.

Distribution
Both papers were distributed in large red newspaper racks and in stores, coffee shops, restaurants, schools and major workplaces. 
Burlingame Daily News, along with five other Daily News editions, was sold to Knight Ridder in 2005. 
After McClatchy's acquisition of Knight Ridder in early 2006, all six Daily News editions, including the Burlingame Daily News, were bundled with the San Jose Mercury News and sold to MediaNews Group of Denver, Colorado. The surviving Daily News papers merged on April 7, 2009.
