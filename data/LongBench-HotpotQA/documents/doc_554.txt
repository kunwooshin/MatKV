Plot
A story about two best friends, Isaac and James (voiced by Katie Leigh), and their discovery of the cause and effect relationship between our cities' storm drains and the world's oceans, lakes and rivers. In the story James throws a wrapper and plastic bottle in the gutter and doesn't believe that it will go all the way to the ocean. His friend Isaac warns James about the consequences of his littering. There begins the adventures of James and Isaac as they learn about the harmful effects of storm drain pollution, and in turn, spread the word to their friends and the rest of their school. Helping the kids along this journey are a concerned Crane (voiced by Xavier Rudd) from the coast line, a surprisingly insightful Surfer Dude and James' Mom (voiced by Amy Smart).
