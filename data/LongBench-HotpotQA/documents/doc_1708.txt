Biography
Given his first break by veteran comics artist Dan Adkins, Bingham's first published comics work was a Green Arrow backup story in World's Finest Comics #251 (June–July 1978). From there, Bingham drew comics for Marvel Comics, First Comics, TSR, Malibu Comics, Dark Horse Comics, Heavy Metal, and others.  He drew the Batman: Son of the Demon graphic novel in 1987, which introduced a character later revealed to be Damian Wayne. This graphic novel reputedly "restored DC Comics to first place in sales after fifteen years."Leaving comics in the late 1990s, Bingham moved to the West Coast, where he did production art for the movies, designing props, special effects and monster make-up. He contributed design work for Walt Disney Parks and Resorts, shopping centers, Universal Studios, and the Hollywood Christmas Parade. In addition, Bingham has illustrated paperback, game, and magazine covers.

Education
Bingham attended the American Academy of Art, the Scottsdale Artists School, the California Art Institute, and UCLA.
