The station was originally operated by Northwood businessman, Marlin Hanson as an oldies radio station with an effective radiated power of 3,000 watts, then 6,000 watts.

It was sold to Dave Nolander who also owned KATE radio in Albert Lea, MN.

The station was sold to Three Eagles Communications and the power increased to 25,000 watts.
