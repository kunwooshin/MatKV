Location
At 7,207 metres (23,645 ft) tall, Tongshanjiabu is the 103rd tallest mountain in the world. It sits in the disputed border territory between Bhutan and China. The name "Tongshanjiabu" is indicated on a map from the Japanese Alpine News, May 2003, p. 44. The region's highpoint is sometimes given as "Teri Kang", but this appears to be the name of a subsidiary top.
