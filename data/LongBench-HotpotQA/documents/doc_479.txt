Tampico Beverages
Tampico Beverages is an American manufacturer of bottled fruit-flavored drinks and gelatin. It is available in the United States and more than 56 countries around the globe. Tampico Beverages is wholly owned by Houchens Industries Inc. since 2008.

History
Founded in 1989, Tampico Beverages began with just one flavor: Citrus Punch.  By the early 1990s, they had secured their first international licensee in Mexico.  The company continued to add flavors and work with licensees to add new package sizes and formats, and, in 2014 its Citrus Gallon had become the number one selling item in the refrigerated drink category in the U.S. Tampico now provides concentrate to licensees in over 50 countries.

Products
As of 2014, Tampico's products were as follows.  In the U.S., these are labeled as a type of soft drink with the word "punch".  The words "fruit" or "juice" do not appear because the bulk consists of water, sugar, and flavoring, with only tiny proportions of fruit juice.
