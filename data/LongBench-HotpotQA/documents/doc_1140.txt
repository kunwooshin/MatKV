Morton number
In fluid dynamics, the Morton number (Mo) is a dimensionless number used together with the Eötvös number or Bond number to characterize the shape of bubbles or drops moving in a surrounding fluid or continuous phase, c.
It is named after Rose Morton, who described it with W. L. Haberman in 1953.

Definition
The Morton number is defined as

  
    
      
        
          M
          o
        
        =
        
          
            
              g
              
                μ
                
                  c
                
                
                  4
                
              
              
              Δ
              ρ
            
            
              
                ρ
                
                  c
                
                
                  2
                
              
              
                σ
                
                  3
                
              
            
          
        
        ,
      
    
    {\displaystyle \mathrm {Mo} ={\frac {g\mu _{c}^{4}\,\Delta \rho }{\rho _{c}^{2}\sigma ^{3}}},}
  where g is the acceleration of gravity, 
  
    
      
        
          μ
          
            c
          
        
      
    
    {\displaystyle \mu _{c}}
   is the viscosity of the surrounding fluid, 
  
    
      
        
          ρ
          
            c
          
        
      
    
    {\displaystyle \rho _{c}}
   the density of the surrounding fluid, 
  
    
      
        Δ
        ρ
      
    
    {\displaystyle \Delta \rho }
   the difference in density of the phases, and 
  
    
      
        σ
      
    
    {\displaystyle \sigma }
   is the surface tension coefficient.  For the case of a bubble with a negligible inner density the Morton number can be simplified to 

  
    
      
        
          M
          o
        
        =
        
          
            
              g
              
                μ
                
                  c
                
                
                  4
                
              
            
            
              
                ρ
                
                  c
                
              
              
                σ
                
                  3
                
              
            
          
        
        .
      
    
    {\displaystyle \mathrm {Mo} ={\frac {g\mu _{c}^{4}}{\rho _{c}\sigma ^{3}}}.}

Relation to other parameters
The Morton number can also be expressed by using a combination of the Weber number, Froude number and Reynolds number,

  
    
      
        
          M
          o
        
        =
        
          
            
              
                W
                e
              
              
                3
              
            
            
              
                
                  F
                  r
                
                
                  2
                
              
              
              
                
                  R
                  e
                
                
                  4
                
              
            
          
        
        .
      
    
    {\displaystyle \mathrm {Mo} ={\frac {\mathrm {We} ^{3}}{\mathrm {Fr} ^{2}\,\mathrm {Re} ^{4}}}.}
  The Froude number in the above expression is defined as

  
    
      
        
          F
          
            r
            
              2
            
          
        
        =
        
          
            
              V
              
                2
              
            
            
              g
              d
            
          
        
      
    
    {\displaystyle \mathrm {Fr^{2}} ={\frac {V^{2}}{gd}}}
  where V is a reference velocity and d is the equivalent diameter of the drop or bubble.
