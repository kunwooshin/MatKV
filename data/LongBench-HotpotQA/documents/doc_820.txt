Crystal River Energy Complex
The Crystal River Energy Complex consists of seven power-generating plants on a 4,700-acre (1,900 ha) site near the mouth of the Crystal River in Citrus County, Florida.  Crystal River 1, 2, 4, and 5 are fossil fuel power plants. Crystal River 3 was previously the sole nuclear power plant on the site (1977-2013). The Crystal River Combined Cycle site consists of two Mitsubishi gas turbines, which came on-line in 2018.  The complex was developed in the early 1960s by the Florida Power Corporation and sold to Progress Energy Inc in 2000. Following Progress Energy's merger with Duke Energy in 2012, the facility is owned and operated by Duke Energy.In February 2013, Duke Energy announced that Crystal River 3 would be permanently shut down.
