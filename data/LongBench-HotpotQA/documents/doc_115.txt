Instead the first official single from the album was the Jazze Pha produced song "So What" featuring R&B singer Ciara. This has become the duo's most successful hit to date, climbing to #10 on the US Billboard Hot 100, and #3 and #4 on the US Hot Rap Tracks and US Hot R&B/Hip Hop Songs charts, respectively.The album itself achieved #1 on the US Billboard Top Rap Albums and #7 on the US Billboard 200.
