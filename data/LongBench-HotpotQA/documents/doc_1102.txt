History
The location was first occupied by a Uniwide Warehouse owned by Jimmy Gow's Uniwide Sales, Inc. and was subsequently sold to Gokongwei, who demolished the warehouse. Construction of the mall began in mid-1998, and Robinsons Metro East opened its doors to the public in 2001. 
The name "Metro East" refers to the fact that the mall is located in the eastern district of the Greater Manila Area, which is in the boundaries of the cities of Pasig and Marikina in Metro Manila and the municipality of Cainta in Rizal.
On September 26, 2009, the basement level of the mall was flooded as a result of Typhoon Ketsana. This, in turn, led to the closure of the entire mall. Renovation of the mall began in August 2011 and was completed in 2012.The mall is connected to the Marikina-Pasig station of the LRT Line 2. An extension of the mall that links to the station's concourse opened in 2022.
