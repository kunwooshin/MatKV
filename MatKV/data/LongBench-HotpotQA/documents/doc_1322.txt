Louisville Thunder
Louisville Thunder was an indoor soccer club based in Louisville, Kentucky that was one of the founding clubs competing in the American Indoor Soccer Association. Peter Mahlock served as President and General Manager and Keith Tozer was the head coach.  During the first season Tozer moved from just coaching to logging shifts as a player/coach.  In their debut season of 1984–1985, goalkeeper Rick Schweizer won the 'Goalkeeper of the Year' award, and made it on to the All-Star team.  The Louisville Thunder played its home games at the Broadbent Arena.
However, in 1987 after winning the AISA league championship over the Canton Invaders, the team disbanded due to ownership problems.
