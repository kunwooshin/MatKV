Complete list of games that Colovini has created:

His games are known for their simplicity and drama as this quote from Board Game Geek illustrates:  "Carcasonne: The Discovery is also the simplest and most vanilla of the Carcassonnes. (Of course, if you know anything about Leo Colovini, you'd expect that.) But, it also the most tense Carcassonne. (And if you know Mr. Colovini, you also knew THAT!)"
