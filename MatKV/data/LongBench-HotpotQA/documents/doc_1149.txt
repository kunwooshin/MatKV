Heaven Only Knows (album)
Heaven Only Knows is the seventh album by R&B crooner Teddy Pendergrass. It was his final studio album for Philadelphia International, released just after he left the label to record for Asylum Records. It produced one single, "I Want My Baby Back," which reached #61 on the Billboard charts in 1984.

Critical reception
The Philadelphia Inquirer noted that, "except for the gentle, eloquent 'Crazy About Your Love', these Gamble- and Huff-produced tunes are mawkish and overblown."
