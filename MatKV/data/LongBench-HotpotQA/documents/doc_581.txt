Description and history
The Stelljes House stands in a rural area of southern Goshen, on the east side of NH 31. It is a 1+1‚ÅÑ2-story wooden structure, with a gabled roof and clapboarded exterior. A brick chimney rises slightly off-center from the roof ridge. The main facade is asymmetrical, with a slightly off-center entrance, two sash windows to its left, and a three-section modern picture window to the right. A gable dormer projects from the rear roof face. An ell extends from the southern portion of the rear of the main block, with a porch in the corner joining the two blocks.The house was built about 1800, and is one of the oldest of Goshen's cluster of plank-frame houses. The framing is three-inch planking attached vertically to sills, which rests on a rubble and granite stone foundation. Dowels are attached horizontally to give this framing lateral stability. The front facade was probably originally five bays across.
