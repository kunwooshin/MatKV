Bishop International Airport
Bishop International Airport (IATA: FNT, ICAO: KFNT, FAA LID: FNT) is a commercial and general aviation airport located in Flint, Michigan, United States. It is named after banker and General Motors board member Arthur Giles Bishop (April 12, 1851 – January 22, 1944), who donated 220 acres of his farmland for the airport in 1928.  It is located in southwestern Flint, and is surrounded by Flint Township to the north, east and west; and Mundy Township to the south.
The third busiest airport in Michigan after those of Detroit and Grand Rapids, it surpassed competitor MBS near Saginaw in terms of airline operations in 2002. 1,071,238 passengers used Bishop International Airport in 2007; 938,914 passengers used the airport in 2011.It is included in the Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) National Plan of Integrated Airport Systems for 2021–2025, in which it is categorized as a non-hub primary commercial service facility.The airport is currently served by three passenger airlines: Allegiant Air operates mainline service out of the airport, and regional services are provided by affiliates of United Express and American Eagle.  The airlines offer passenger flights to 13 cities across the United States.  The airport became a focus city for Allegiant on February 19, 2022.Accompanying the airlines is fixed-base operator AvFlight, which handles both general aviation and airline operations. Also based at the airport are flight schools Greater Flint Pilots Association, American Wings Aviation, and Crosswinds Aviation.

History
In 1928, the Arthur Giles Bishop family gave to the City of Flint 220 acres for aeronautical purposes. The city-operated Bishop Airport until 1987 when the city and Genesee County formed the Bishop International Airport Authority to run the airport.The renovation and expansion of the current terminal, originally built in 1993, was designed by Reynolds, Smith & Hills.

Historic airline service
When the current terminal was completed in 1993, most airlines serving Flint were using propeller aircraft, which included Northwest Airlink and Skyway Airlines (operating as Midwest Connect).  US Air was the only airline providing jet service at the time, which they operated to their hub in Pittsburgh.In 1997, ValuJet Airlines began service to Flint, which became Flint's first low-cost carrier.  ValuJet was merged into AirTran Airways later that year, who continued to provide flights to Atlanta.  The success of AirTran's flights led them to increase service which prompted Northwest Airlines, who operated a major hub nearby in Detroit, to also increase service to Flint.  For much of the 2000s, competition between AirTran and Northwest brought growth in air service to Flint which included flights to Florida and Las Vegas.  Competition between the two airlines was so heavy, both airlines would often announce new competing services within days of each other.In 2001, Delta Air Lines began flights to Flint starting with Delta Connection flights to their hub in Cincinnati which operated for a few years.  Delta flights to their hub in Atlanta were added in 2003.In 2002, ATA Connection (operated by Chicago Express Airlines) began flights from Flint to Chicago Midway Airport using Saab 340 turboprop aircraft.  ATA Connection also briefly operated flights to Indianapolis before ATA Airlines shutdown ATA Connection in 2005.  American Eagle subsequently started flights to Chicago O'Hare International Airport by the end of that year.  American Eagle also had flights from Flint to Dallas/Fort Worth and LaGuardia Airport in New York in the late 2000s.Northwest Airlines, who operated in Flint for many years, was merged into Delta Air Lines in 2009.  After the merger, Delta continued to operate flights to Detroit and Minneapolis/St. Paul, which Northwest previously operated.  However, Delta discontinued the short flights to Detroit in 2013.United Express added flights to Chicago O'Hare International Airport in 2014 after discontinuing flights to Cleveland (which had started years earlier by United's predecessor Continental Airlines).AirTran was merged into Southwest Airlines in 2014.  Southwest continued to serve Flint briefly following the merger and offered Boeing 737 flights from Flint to Las Vegas, Orlando, Tampa, Baltimore, and seasonal service to Fort Myers before dropping them and serving only Chicago Midway Airport in 2016. While flights to Midway were full, Southwest did not see adequate profit from the short flight and ceased service to Flint in 2018.After Southwest's service downgrade in 2016, Allegiant Air saw the demand in Flint for low cost flights to popular tourist destinations and began service to Orlando/Sanford and Tampa/Clearwater – St. Petersburg in 2016. The success of those routes led to additional service to Punta Gorda, Florida, in 2018 and seasonal service to both Ft. Lauderdale and Myrtle Beach.Although Allegiant was a welcome to passengers at Flint, the lack of daily flights that Southwest had offered plus the Delta Connection cancellation of their twice daily Minneapolis flight led Flint to their lowest passenger numbers in over a decade. Statistics from the airport for 2018 show the number of passengers boarding flights at Bishop down about 10%: from 400,781 in 2017 to 360,609 in 2018, the lowest number of departing flights from Flint since 2002. Allegiant Air added service between Flint and Nashville on June 5, 2020. On November 17, 2020, Allegiant announced it would begin service between Flint and Las Vegas, starting March 4, 2021. Allegiant has announced it will offer service to Boston and Jacksonville, Florida starting in March 2022. On February 1, 2022, Allegiant later announced it will begin serve between Flint and Savannah, Georgia beginning April 15, 2022.Despite the 2018 results, early 2019 saw Allegiant become the number-one air carrier in Flint, carrying 41% of Flint's passengers in February. Envoy Air (as American Eagle) also started a fourth daily flight to Chicago O'Hare. On April 11, 2019, PSA Airlines (as American Eagle) announced twice daily service to Charlotte to begin in September 2019.  American's flights to Charlotte were discontinued in 2022.Delta Air Lines indefinitely suspended flights their last remaining service from Flint to Atlanta due to the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on aviation. Despite ending Flint service, Delta still serves nearby airports such as MBS International Airport near Saginaw and Detroit Metropolitan Airport.

Renovations
In early February 2007, Bishop International Airport unveiled a comprehensive five-year developmental plan that would be slated for continuation through late 2011. The program called for two phases of "Intermodal Facility Development," including the expansion of the West Cargo Apron, what is now known as the Abex and Emory GVA Freight Ramp, located on the airport's northwest side.
In May 2009, Bishop International Airport began Phase I of its Terminal Airside & Concourse Improvements program. Projects under this phase were developed in 2008. Included in this phase are upgrades to the terminal ramp, upon which the passenger concourse resides; the permanent closure and deconstruction of Runway 5/23; and the acquisition of new land for an envisioned Runway 09L/27R, which was scheduled to be designed in 2009 and constructed in 2010.
Runway 5/23 was closed permanently on May 4, 2009 as progress continued in the Capital Improvement Program.
The renovation and expansion of the terminal, originally built in 1993, was designed by Reynolds, Smith & Hills.On April 24, 2012, the airport's board of directors approved a $1.348 million project to repair the airport's tarmac. On September 19, 2012, it was announced that the Federal Aviation Administration approved a grant to fund the project.On October 6, 2012, a new Transportation Security Administration checkpoint opened in the terminal.The completed terminal was dedicated on November 13, 2012.The airport's board allocated an additional $10.9 million for upgrades in 2013 and 2014.On August 29, 2013, the airport received a $2.87 million grant from the U.S. Department of Transportation, which was used to repair taxiways and lighting and to buy a replacement snow truck.On September 28, 2017, the airport received a $4.302 million grant from the Federal Aviation Administration which will be used to rehabilitate the pavement of Taxiway C, construct asphalt shoulders and install runway guard lights at each access point to the runway.On July 30, 2018, the FAA gave the airport a $4,012,542 grant for taxiway construction, rehabilitation and lighting.On June 5, 2019, the FAA gave the airport $8,056,505 for runway reconstruction, the addition of runway shoulders, and enhancements to the runway’s lighting system.
