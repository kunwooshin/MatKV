Life
David was the son of John de Inchmartin. He held lands in Inchmartine (now Inchture), in Perth and Kinross. He was with Robert the Bruce at the Battle of Methven. During the battle on 19 June 1306, David was captured by English forces under Aymer de Valence, Earl of Pembroke. A number of Bruce's closest supporters were also captured. The Earl of Pembroke refused to summarily execute the prisoners as ordered by Edward I of England. David was executed by hanging on 4 August at Newcastle-upon-Tyne.
