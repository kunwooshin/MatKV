History
KAND began in 1937 as a Variety/Entertainment station on 1310 kHz but 10 years later moved to AM 1340 and has maintained its variety format until the 1980s when they made a slow transition to Country music. The original station owner was J.C. West, who also owned the Wolf Brand (canned) Chili plant in Corsicana. West had applied for callsign WOLF, but the Federal Communications Commission wouldn't permit it because the WOLF call letters are currently in use on Syracuse, New York's AM station.
In March 2008 Yates Communications announced FCC approval to buy KAND.
On July 9, 2010, Yates decided to sell this station to New Century BroadcastingIn 2014, KAND shifted to country full-time and switched news sources from ABC News to CBS.
