Track listing
Music video
The music video for "Weapon" was directed by Matthew Good and Ante Kovac. It was filmed on October 5, 2002, at Pier 94. In a later commentary, Good related that Kovac's first edit of the video was far too standard, with gratuitous and generic fades. After firing Kovac, Good flew to Toronto and worked with video editor Jay Deschamps to re-craft the footage. While working on the edit, Good began to experiment with overlaying text and adding still frames and stock photos to help deliver the message. Good noted that the video was his favourite from his catalogue.
The video won the award for "Best Video" at the 2003 Juno Awards. Good did not attend the ceremony and Kovac accepted the award alone.
