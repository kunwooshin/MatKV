Dong'ou Kingdom
Dong'ou (simplified Chinese: 东瓯; traditional Chinese: 東甌; pinyin: Dōng'ōu) also known as Ouyue (simplified Chinese: 瓯越; traditional Chinese: 甌越; pinyin: Ōuyuè), was an ancient  kingdom in modern Wenzhou and Taizhou, Zhejiang Province, China. The realm of Dong'ou was given to Zou Yao by Emperor Gaozu of Han in 192 BC. During the Han campaigns against Minyue in 138 BC, the king of Dong'ou no longer wished to live in his realm after the incident, and had all his people moved into the Han dynasty.
