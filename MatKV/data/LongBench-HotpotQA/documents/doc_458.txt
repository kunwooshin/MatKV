Education
Tri County Area Schools, which operates Tri County High School, serves Sand Lake. The district was a consolidation of the Sand Lake and Howard City school boards. It came into existence on April 3, 1962, the day members of those communities voted in favor of consolidating their schools. The consolidated schools began operation in fall 1962.Prior to the consolidation, Sand Lake High School, a K-12 school, served the community. Impetus for consolidation occurred when the State of Michigan adopted new standards for education which required school systems to spend additional funds. Some Sand Lake residents wished to consolidate with Cedar Springs Schools in Cedar Springs due to the strength of the Cedar Springs industrial economy and the good reputation of its school system, while others wished to consolidate with Howard City. Charles Northup, a former member of the Sand Lake school board, stated that Cedar Springs residents would have had primary control and naming of a consolidated school district including Sand Lake, while a consolidation with Howard City would result in joint control between the communities. According to a former principal of Sand Lake High, Earl Clegg, "community friction" occurred in the consolidation debate. About 300 people went to a meeting in Sand Lake on proposed school consolidation on February 13, 1961.The Nelson Township Branch of the Kent District Library is located in Sand Lake.
