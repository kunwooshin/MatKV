Game summaries
Eastern Washington
Washington Husky cornerback Desmond Trufant intercepted a pass by Eastern Washington Eagles' quarterback Bo Levi Mitchell in the end zone with 29 seconds left to preserve a 30–27 win on September 3. Trufant wrestled the pass away from 6-foot-5 Eagles receiver Brandon Kaufman. Mitchell passed for 473 yards on the night, completed 39 of 69 passes, and had 3 touchdowns against 2 interceptions. For Washington, quarterback Keith Price threw three touchdown passes and completed 17 of 25 passes for 102 yards, and running back Chris Polk ran for 125 yards on 23 carries. Washington gained fewer total yards than Eastern Washington – 250 yards compared to 504 for the Eagles – but had zero turnovers while the Eagles gave up the ball four times. Trufant had forced another one of those turnovers during the first quarter; he stripped Matt Johnson on a punt return and created a short field for the Huskies that led to a 7-yard touchdown pass from Price to Jonathan Amosa.After the game, the Pac-12 Conference named Trufant Pac-12 defensive player of week. Washington placekicker Erik Folk was named Pac-12 special teams player of the week. Polk was a perfect 3-for-3 on field goals during the game and all three of his field goals came from outside of 40 yards.
