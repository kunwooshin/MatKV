Trafford Bar tram stop
Trafford Bar is a tram stop on Greater Manchester's light rail system, Metrolink, at the junction of Talbot Road and Seymour Grove in Old Trafford. It opened on 15 June 1992 as part of Phase 1 of Metrolink's expansion, before which it was a mainline railway station.

History
The station was opened as Old Trafford on 20 July 1849 by the Manchester, South Junction and Altrincham Railway (MSJ&AR). It closed as a British Rail station on 24 December 1991, and the "Old Trafford" name was transferred to the former Warwick Road Station, to avoid confusion for passengers travelling to Old Trafford Football Ground and Old Trafford Cricket Ground. It was renamed Trafford Bar when it reopened as a Metrolink station on 15 June 1992. Due to the station's close proximity to Old Trafford football ground it is frequently used on match-days by fans using the East Didsbury – Rochdale service.
